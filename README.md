Super Holiday Snake
===

A real-time multiplayer [phaser](http://phaser.io/) game using node and websockets to make the magic happen.

Started with the tutorial found here:
http://rawkes.com/articles/creating-a-real-time-multiplayer-game-with-websockets-and-node.html

And Phaser's [tanks example game](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/blob/master/examples/games/tanks.js).

And heavily indebted to:

On the shoulders of giants and all that...
